# Fraud-SMS-Detection-Application
## Project Overview
The SMS Fraud Detection Application project is a bachelor’s degree capstone project at King Mongkut’s University of Technology Thonburi, developed collaboratively by a team. Its objective is to protect users from scams by enabling them to identify fraudulent SMS messages. The application assists users in determining which SMS messages can be trusted and collects user data to improve the accuracy of its machine-learning model. This effort aims to address the growing issue of SMS scams that proliferate.

The Beebuzz application operates on the Android platform and detects suspicious SMS messages using Natural Language Processing (NLP), a branch of artificial intelligence (AI). It is capable of identifying fraudulent SMS messages in both Thai and English. Users must grant access to their SMS messages and contact lists so the application can analyze received messages, including links, to assess risks. The application alerts users to the risk level of received SMS messages and links. Additionally, it features a keyword filter that automatically removes messages containing specified keywords, preventing them from being displayed to users.

Developed using advanced deep learning techniques, the application achieves high accuracy in classifying fraudulent SMS messages. For English messages, the GRU model demonstrated an accuracy of 98.94%, while for Thai messages, the LSTM model achieved an accuracy of 96.62%, based on rigorous testing of multiple deep learning models. These results underscore the application's effectiveness in detecting scams in two different languages, leveraging the strengths of each model type for specific language contexts.

The application provides accurate and reliable SMS predictions, achieving its goal of effectively protecting users from falling prey to scams. It has garnered positive feedback and satisfaction from users. Suggestions provided by users will be collected and utilized to further improve the model and application in future iterations.
