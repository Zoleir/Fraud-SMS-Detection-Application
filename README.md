# Fraud-SMS-Detection-Application
With the popularity of mobile devices and the ease of communication they offer, SMS (Short Message Service) has become a common tool for personal and business exchanges. However, this convenience also opens the door to SMS fraud, encompassing various deceptive practices such as phishing, fraud, and misinformation. Detecting fraudulent SMS messages is crucial to safeguard users from potential harm.

This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP), a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI), to detect fraudulent SMS messages in both Thai and English languages. By analyzing the content of SMS messages, the system aims to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent messages, thereby enhancing mobile security.
